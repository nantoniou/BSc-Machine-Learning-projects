# Machine-Learning-projects
A repository containing projects made to get familiar with Machine Learning. The projects are the following:
* The first project explores [Airline On-Time Performance Data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time#), by using basic Pandas and Matplotlib functions.
* The second project explores the success of political campaigns (protests), as seen at [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw), using more advanced Matplotlib plots and logistic regression, from the `Statsmodels` library.
* The third project uses the Tweepy API to fetch tweets from members of the European Parliament. Those tweets are clustered, using `K-means`, and multiple classification algorithms are made, to try to classify new tweets into their MEP group.
* The fourth project contains the development of a neural network for the [Image CLEF 2019 Concept Detection Task](https://www.imageclef.org/2019/medical/caption/). It is a multi-label classifiaction task, whose aim is to identify medical terms in radiology images.<br><br>
*Note*: the repository does not contain the data used, but includes the sources.<br>
